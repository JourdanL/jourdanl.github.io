I am Léane Jourdan, a first year PhD. student at Nantes Université in France. I am part of the [TALN research group](https://taln-ls2n.github.io/) at the [LS2N laboratory](https://www.ls2n.fr/).
I work under the supervision of [Richard Dufour](https://cv.hal.science/richard-dufour), [Florian Boudin](https://boudinfl.github.io/) and [Nicolas Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-hernandez-28856b2/).

My research lies within the field of NLP and my main research interests are scientific writing assistance and text revision.

In july 2022 I graduated from Nantes Universiy and obtained my master degree in Computer Science with a speciality in Natural Language processing.
