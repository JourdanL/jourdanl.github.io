Today is my first day as a PH.D. student in the [TALN research group](https://taln-ls2n.github.io/) at the [LS2N laboratory](https://www.ls2n.fr/). For the next three years I will work under the supervision of [Richard Dufour](https://cv.hal.science/richard-dufour), [Florian Boudin](https://boudinfl.github.io/) and [Nicolas Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-hernandez-28856b2/) on the subject "Neuronal approaches for modelling and analysing the argumentative structure of Research articles".
