On June 5th our [research group](https://taln-ls2n.github.io/) organized the [ARTS workshop](https://arts2023.sciencesconf.org/)(Analysis and Research of Scientific Texts) at the French NLP national conference in Paris.


This workshop was a huge success and gathered around 50 researchers. I had the opportunity to take part of it as a member of the organization committee.

13 papers have been accepted and presented with a booster and poster. We also had a keynote from Mathieu Constant about his work on [ISTEX](https://www.istex.fr/)

I myself had the opportunity to publish an article about my ongoing work: "CASIMIR : un Corpus d'Articles Scientifiques Intégrant les ModIfications et Révisions des auteurs".
You can [download the paper here](https://hal.science/hal-04103347) and find the [poster](https://hal.science/hal-04122594) and booster slides below.
