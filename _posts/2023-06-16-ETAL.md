üåû This month I went one week to Marseille, in the south of France, to join a NLP summer school: [ETAL 2023](https://etal2023.lis-lab.fr/).

‚õ± ETAL was held at the [CIRM](https://www.cirm-math.fr/index.html) (Centre International de Rencontres Math√©matiques) at the luminy campus in the middle of the Calanques National Park.
The summer school was 4.5 day long of lectures, social sessions and labs on the basis of NLP.

üè° The place was amazing and structured as a small village, I had the opportunity to meet wonderful people and open myself to different NLP applications outside my research area (Information retrieval, multimodality, cognitive science, speech‚Ä¶)
