üèî Last week I attended the Advanced Language Processing School winter school from January 16th to Friday 20th 2023: [ALPS 2023](http://alps-2023.imag.fr/index.html). It was an online school co-organized by the LIG (Univ. Grenoble Alpes) and Naver Labs Europe.

‚õÑÔ∏è The winter school was 5 day long of lectures, social sessions and labs on the current topics and approach in NLP. Expert speakers presented their recent research or area of expertise.
