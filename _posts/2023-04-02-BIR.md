On April 2nd, I got the oppurtunity to present my first article "Text revision in Scientific Writing Assistance: An Overview" at the [BIR 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/bir-ws/bir-2023) workshop. The workshop took place during [ECIR 2023](https://ecir2023.org/) in Dublin, Ireland.
You can [download the paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16726.pdf).
